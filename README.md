# Python Compiler v2

This repository contains a Python compiler that checks the lex and syntax of a Python file without proceeding with the actual compilation in the next stage. The compiler uses the test to compile the example.py file.

## Usage

To use the Python compiler, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
    
2.  Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the project.
    
3.  Run the following command to generate the lex and parser files:
    
    css
    

-   `flex flex.l bison -d parser.y`
    
-   Run the following command to compile the project:
    
-   `gcc -o compiler lex.yy.c parser.tab.c`
    
-   Run the following command to test the compiler:
    
    bash
    

1.  `./compiler < example.py`
    

The compiler will check the lex and syntax of the example.py file and display any errors or warnings in the terminal window.

## Files

This repository contains the following files:

-   `bnf_of_python.txt`: This file contains the Backus-Naur Form (BNF) of the Python language.
-   `example.py`: This file is a sample Python file that can be used to test the compiler.
-   `flex.l`: This file contains the Flex code for the lexer.
-   `lex.yy.c`: This file is generated by Flex and contains the C code for the lexer.
-   `parser.tab.c`: This file is generated by Bison and contains the C code for the parser.
-   `parser.tab.h`: This file is generated by Bison and contains the header file for the parser.
-   `parser.y`: This file contains the Bison code for the parser.
-   `test`: This directory contains additional test files to check the functionality of the compiler.
